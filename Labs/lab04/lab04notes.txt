Notes from Lab 04

Avoid using getchar, use cin.get() instead
	getchar is C standard, may run into trouble if we do sync_with_stdio(false)

Problem Sets: Actually no need to store the output lines into one massive array/vector
	Instead, can just read and output at the same time (i.e. scan the cin and then output, then continue to cin)

Can convert char to int using int (char - '0')

To read string until newline character is reached,
	Use getline
	Or can look into stringstream
